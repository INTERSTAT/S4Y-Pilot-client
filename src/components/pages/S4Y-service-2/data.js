export const SERVICE_2_DESCRIPTION = `The main goal of this service is to compare the distribution of private and public schools in selected municipalities in France and Italy, in terms of number of students, type, grade and number of schools. This analysis may enhance the coverage of public and private scholar services in a selected area in relation with the resident population resulting from census data.
The user can select an Italian and a French municipality and a school year. The number of public and private schools and the value of the resident population in the specific areas are obtained.
The analysis also makes it possible to link census data to school data, associating the ISCED code to the appropriate age group that falls within the school grade.`;
